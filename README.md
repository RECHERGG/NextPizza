## 📖 Background

At the company, pizza was ordered once a week — but the selection was often random. No one really knew how many slices were needed or how to balance preferences between meat, vegetarian, and vegan options.

**NextPizza** was created to solve that.

The idea was to build a simple internal tool where team members could specify how many slices of each type they wanted. Based on that data, charts and summaries could be generated to guide smarter ordering decisions.

## 🔐 Features

- Custom user authentication system  
- Slice tracking by category (meat / veggie / vegan)  
- Visual comparison charts for easy overview  
- User list and individual preferences
